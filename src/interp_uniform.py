This file is a shortened version of the scipy.interpolate.interp1d algorithm,
restricted to linear interpolation and lacks most of the checks and robustness
of the scipy version. In addition, it is specific to the case of uniform spacing
in x. It is faster, but must be run correctly (undefined behavior otherwise).
